* [Academic Credit Recovery (coming soon)](url), helping former students of these facilities recover the academic credits and education they lost during their time at a troubled teen facility.  

* [Exploration of Sanctuary remedies](url), a future project to support minors who depart a facility, but don't have a home to return to.

[Join us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nostoneunturnedchurch) to follow our ministries (projects), most of which currently involve efforts to end institutional child abuse and extrajudicial child and teen incarcerations.

NSU was founded in May, 2021.

Within each of us, there exists a rudiment of goodness that is called moral faith. 

When we choose to cultivate, rather than suppress, the nugget of kindness that we were born with, we can perpetually aspire to give humbly of ourselves to others who are in need, without expectation of reciprocity or gratitude. 

Your belief in each individual's intrinsic altruism has pre-built NSU's foundation. Thank you!


No Stone Unturned (NSU) is an Intrinsic Altruist Church headquartered in Madison, WI. 

NSU welcomes members of all faiths, including members of no faith.
