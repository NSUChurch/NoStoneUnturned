# No Stone Unturned

Within each of us, there exists a rudiment of goodness that is called moral faith. 

When we choose to cultivate, rather than suppress, the nugget of kindness that we were born with, we can perpetually aspire to give humbly of ourselves to others who are in need, without expectation of reciprocity or gratitude. 

Your belief in each individual's intrinsic altruism has pre-built NSU's foundation. Thank you!
