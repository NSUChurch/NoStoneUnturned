# No Stone Unturned

We believe in Intrinsic Altruism.

We believe that there exists, within each of us, a rudiment of goodness that is called moral faith. 

When you choose to cultivate, rather than suppress, the nugget of kindness that you were born with, you can perpetually aspire to give humbly of yourself to others who are in need, without expectation of reciprocity or gratitude. 

Intrinsic Altruism helps each of us to maintain motivation to provide assistance to other humans to reduce suffering and improve the conditions of humanity.

We are a church. We welcome members of all faiths, including members of no faith.
